# Memo Management

This tool helps on the process of creating, organizing, and distributing internal communications within the workplace. Memos are mostly written messages that are used to convey important information, such as announcements, policy updates, or project status reports. 

## Memo Management Key Features

* `Memo Addition` - This lets the admin add a specific/version name to the new memo, and this asks a pdf file to be uploaded on the workplace.
* `Memo Deletion` - Deletes the memo on the workplace, but keeps the announcement.
* `Memo Download` - Let's the admins download the memo uploaded.
* `Memo View` - This shows and displays the specific memo selected on the page.
* `Memo - Announcement Posting` - The memo can be posted as an announcement, upon ticking the checkbox if it will be announcement the app will ask a specific title that the admin can fill out for the announcement. 

## Memo Management Additional Notes

The memo - announcement will still act as a regular announcement with just an information that a new memo has been added, but will be posted upon creation and have the audience targeted for everyone on the workplace.
