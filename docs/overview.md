# Overview

This documentation will guide you through the whole process of the workplace. 

Overall we have 2 portal types in the workplace, this portal acts as the main separator between the management and employee. They can be used to streamline various HR-related processes and improve communication between management and employees.

The Management and Employee portals can help the workplace improve the efficiency of its HR processes, reduce administrative tasks, and improve communication and collaboration between managers and employees.

* `Management/Administration Portal` - This portal contains all the necessary data and actions to manage the whole workplace.
* `Employee Portal` - This portal contains all the necessary data and actions for each employee/staff/member/basic user for the workplace. 


Both of the above have their own modules/pages/functionalities, the information from the next pages will help you understand what that specific module is for and how it works inside the workplace.
