# Getting Started

This documentation will guide you through the whole process of the workplace. 

Overall we have 2 portal types in the workplace, this portal acts as the main separator between the management and employee. They can be used to streamline various HR-related processes and improve communication between management and employees.

The Management and Employee portals can help the workplace improve the efficiency of its HR processes, reduce administrative tasks, and improve communication and collaboration between managers and employees.

* `Management/Administration Portal` - This portal contains all the necessary data and actions to manage the whole workplace.
* `Employee Portal` - This portal contains all the basic data and actions for each employee/staff/member/basic user for the workplace. 


Both portal has basically have the same data, the main difference is that for the Management Portal - The Users in here has access to manage each of the modules/features under the whole workplace this includes the Creation, Deletion, and Updating Permissions, whilst the Employee portal can only do the basics operations under the workplace. The information from the next pages will help you understand what that specific module is for and how it works inside the workplace.
